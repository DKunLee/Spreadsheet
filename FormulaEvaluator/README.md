# Assignment Specific Topics:

    This Formula object will store the expression to evaluate (e.g., "1+A2") along with any
    other needed information, and can then be used to "re-evaluate" the expression whenever
    necessary (e.g., when a dependee changes).
    The key implementation in this Formula class is once you create the expression with
    normalizer and validator, you can't edit or change variable. It means we could not directly
    use this in spreadsheet project.
